# Building a Home Lab in Oracle Virtual Box (Sandbox Enviroment) 
Setting up an Enviroment to for testing new methods, processes, or possible tools to use. 
## Objective
Building a home lab is to create a practical learning environment where you can develop and enhance your cybersecurity skills, gain hands-on experience, and prepare for professional certifications and challenges in the field.

### Skills Learned
- Virtualization: Learn how to create, configure, and manage virtual machines (VMs) in Virtual Box.
- Operating Systems: Gain experience installing, configuring, and securing various operating systems (OS) within virtual machines.
- Network Configuration: Practice setting up and managing virtual networks, including IP addressing, DHCP, DNS, and routing.
- Network Configuration: Practice setting up and managing virtual networks, including IP addressing, DHCP, DNS, and routing.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
**Preface**: Before starting this Project, ensure your PC has Virtualization enabled and your PC specs are capable of Virtualizing.
